<!-- Hey Tiffany! This is the second time I've ever created a website, and this one
	 looks significantly better than my first one. There was a lot of new material
	 I had to learn, so this challenge definitely took me longer than 1-2 hours.
	 However, I hope that you find the website to be as aesthetically pleasing
	 as I do! I plan to only get better at front-end development as summer
	 approaches, learning whatever I need to be able to fulfill my responsibilites
	 for the team.

	 	-Daniel -->
